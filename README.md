# ecs-explorer

ecs-explorer is a tool to explore a contract system implemented using ECS.

## Usage

Open two command lines. In the first one, run the following command:

```bash
yarn

```

In the second, once the first has deployed the contracts and started the chain, run:

cd packages/client
yarn start
```

The project should be visible at http://localhost:3000.
